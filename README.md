# 🏥 30-Day Diabetic Patients Readmission Predictor

A machine learning web application that predicts whether a diabetic patient
will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge — built with
an ensemble of gradient boosting models and deployed via Streamlit.

## 🧠 Confusion Matrix (Test Set)

|  | Predicted Not Readmitted | Predicted Readmitted |
|--|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Actual Not Readmitted** | 25,606 (TN) | 1,517 (FP) |
| **Actual Readmitted** | 89 (FN) | 27,034 (TP) |

- Very low false negatives — critical for healthcare applications.
- Model favours false positives over false negatives, the safer tradeoff
  in a clinical context.

## 📈 Classification Report (Test Set)

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Not Readmitted (0) | 0.94 | 0.94 | 0.97 |
| Readmitted (1) | 0.95 | 1.00 | 0.97 |
| **Overall Accuracy** | | | **0.97** |

The model achieves **perfect recall (1.00)** for readmitted patients,
meaning it misses almost no high-risk cases — the most important
property for a clinical screening tool.

## 🖥️ Dashboard Features

Built with **Streamlit** — replaces the original Flask frontend with a
faster, more maintainable single-file deployment.

- Inputs organised into four clinical sections:
  Patient Demographics · Hospital Stay · Lab Results · Medications
- Risk output with probability score and colour-coded verdict
  (High Risk / Low Risk)
- Animated gauge chart showing readmission probability
- Quick-view summary chips for key patient indicators
- Prediction threshold set at **≥ 25%** for high-risk classification
- Clinical disclaimer on every result

```

## 🧪 Sample Predictions

**High Risk Patient**
Age: 85 · Female · Glucose >300 · A1C >8 · Insulin: Up · 3 prior inpatient visits
→ `Likely to be readmitted`

**Low Risk Patient**
Age: 35 · Male · Glucose Normal · A1C None · Insulin: No · 2 outpatient visits
→ `Not likely to be readmitted`
